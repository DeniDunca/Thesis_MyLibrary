# Next in “My library”

The application works very well, no bugs found yet

What it needs to be done for the app: (create models for recommendation system and implement them into the app)

- create the models that i want to use (documentation on them and goo uderstanding of the jupyter model)
- convert end export the models as .tflite files
- using machine learning firestore upload the models
- use the generated code and add it into aplication
- and test if it really works
- test if the recommandation is updating when book list is changed

What it needs to be done for the documentation

- start to get used to Latex writing
- find as many relatable research papers
- create schemes for architecture, database, etc (research on this scope to see how are mobile apps documented, in special kotlin apps)
- start creating a standard table of contents with all the supchapters that i want to write about
- corelate the research papers and other bibliografies for each chapter
- start writing for each chapter
